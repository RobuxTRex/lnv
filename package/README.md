# lNV

lNV is a light-weight .eNV file read/write package.
lNV isn't very feature-rich compared to dotENV, but for small projects like Discord bots, all you need is a read function, it's wasted space.
This package also targets to become as easy-to-use as possible!

The documentation will be available soon, at:
https://lnv.robuxtrex.co.uk

## Early Access

As this is my first package, I would like to clarify that some versions may/will not work. Use at your own risk.
Though, you can always help me on GitHub issues :D
