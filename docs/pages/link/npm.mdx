# lNV

<Callout type="warning">
    lNV is Work in Progress, so some of the features you may see on this page may not exist yet as of v1.0.0-4
</Callout>

lNV is a light-weight .eNV file read/write package.
lNV isn't very feature-rich compared to dotENV, but for small projects like Discord bots, all you need is a read function, it's wasted space.
This package also targets to become as easy-to-use as possible!

## Early Access

As this is my first package, I would like to clarify that some versions may/will not work. Use at your own risk.
Though, you can always help me on GitHub issues :D
