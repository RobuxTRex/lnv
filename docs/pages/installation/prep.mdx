# Installation - Preperation

<Callout type="error">
    **If your system is not compatible with Node.js, you unfortunately cannot install lNV or any other NPM packages.**
</Callout>

Before we do anything, we must prepare for the installation! Please skip to the next page if you:

- Have a preferred text editor installed and set-up
- Have <a href="https://nodejs.org">Node.js</a> installed

## Installing a text editor

The developers of lNV highly reccommend the use of <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com">VSCode</a>, but any editor is great.
Just make sure your selected editor has a `terminal`, or you have opened the terminal on your Operating System and have opened your project's folder.

## Installing Node.js

Node.js is a necessity when it comes to installing NPM packages.
Head to <a class="font-semibold" href="https://nodejs.org">Node.js'</a> official website and install the latest version of Node.js.
Go through the installer as usual, and when you have successfully complete setup, go to your terminal and run `node -v` to verify the installation worked!

<Callout type="info">
    Make sure you re-open your terminal after installing Node!
</Callout>

## Conclusion

You're now ready to install lNV into your project! Navigate to the next page to begin the installation of my package.
