# Installation

<Callout type="info">
    Ensure you have Node.js installed with your terminal open to follow this guide!
</Callout>

Now that you have all the necessities installed onto your system, let's get installing!

## Checking NPM

Once you have opened your terminal and opened your project folder, run:

```
npm -v
```


If this command returned a version string - like 8.19.2 (the latest at the time of writing) - you're good-to-go and you can continue to the next sub-section of this page.
Otherwise, run:

```
node -v
```

If it doesn't return a version string, try and re-install Node.js. If it does, then google some answers cuz i've never encountered that...

        ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab>
        ```
        yarn add lnv
